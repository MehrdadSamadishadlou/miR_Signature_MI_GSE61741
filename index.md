## Finding a microRNA signature for Myocardial Infarction Diagnosis

### What I want to do?

Myocardial infarction is responsible for 85% of mortalities of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), as the leading cause of mortality worldwide. There are different approaches available for MI diagnosis including protein biomarkers. Biomarkers like cardiac troponins (cTn) are guiding treatment decisions for CVD and as a result of improved assay sensitivities, detection of minute changes in cTn levels became possible [2]. Therefore, for the first time, myocardial injury is defined as a different disease from myocardial infarction in the fourth universal definition of MI [3]. A drawback of the higher sensitivity is a higher possibility of false positives. In this respect, exploring new and novel biomarkers seems attractive. On the other hand, since the survival rate in MI cases strongly depends on fast diagnosis and treatment, discovering novel biomarkers for rapid and accurate diagnosis is of great importance [4].

Noncoding RNAs are under investigation as alternative and complementary biomarker candidates [2]. Amongst noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) are of particular interest, since they regulate key elements of gene expression, and various biological processes [5]. MicroRNAs are small (18â€“24 nucleotides) single-stranded noncoding RNAs that are of great importance in cardiac pathophysiologies, such as hypertrophy, arrhythmia, and ischemia. Therefore, microRNAs are under special attention as possible CVD biomarkers [6]. Although, further systematic investigations should be conducted on their potential as novel biomarkers for MI diagnosis.

In the broader project, we aimed to identify a miRNA signature and manufacture a biosensor for their detection to diagnose MI. This repository is related to the signature identification step. Before this step, The GSE6174 dataset includes the expression profile of 866 miRNAs for 1049 samples, from which 62 samples are acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction cases and 94 samples are healthy controls has been downloaded. In total, 100 differentially expressed miRNAs were detected in samples from MI patients in comparison to healthy controls at an adjusted significance level of p-value < 0.05 and log2 FC < -1 or > 1. Histogram plots of the log2 FC and the adjusted p-values are presented in Fig. 1a, b. From whole differentially expressed miRNAs, 68 were upregulated, while only 32 were downregulated in MI patients.
